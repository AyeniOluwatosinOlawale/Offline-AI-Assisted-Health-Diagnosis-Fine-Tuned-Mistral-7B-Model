# Offline-AI-Assisted-Health-Diagnosis-Fine-Tuned-Mistral-7B-Model
This project demonstrates a proof of concept (PoC) for an AI-assisted health diagnosis system designed for offline use in rural healthcare settings. The objective was to fine-tune the Mistral 7B model using radiology-specific datasets to improve diagnostic accuracy in medical Q&amp;A tasks â€” and deploy the model locally using Ollama.
